# Dark and Stormy Archives Puddles

The Dark and Stormy Archives Project is an attempt to generate meaningful "stories", summaries of web archive collections. Web archive collections consist of tens or even hundreds of thousands of archived web pages, or mementos. Differentiating between two collections is difficult, if not impossible, without reviewing all of these documents. This repository contains the summaries produced by the project.
