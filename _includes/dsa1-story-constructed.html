        This story was constructed automatically by using an updated version of AlNoamany's Algorithm. For more information about how this algorithm was developed, how it works, and its evaluation, please consult:

    <p>We employed the DSA toolkit to tell this story with the following steps.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Hypercane selected the resources and generated the metadata for the story:</li>
        <ol>
            <li>It first executed AlNoamany's Algorithm:</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Discovered the Memento TimeMaps for the collection</li>
                <li>Analyzed these TimeMaps and reported the memento URI-Ms that were on-topic</li>
                <li>Filtered the content of those URI-Ms to find non-duplicates</li>
                <li>Filtered the content of those URI-Ms to find English language documents</li>
                <li>Sliced the collection by memento-datetime</li>
                <li>Clustered the mementos in each slice by Simhash distance</li>
                <li>Ranked the mementos in each cluster by a ranking equation</li>
                <li>Filtered each cluster for the highest ranking mementos</li>
                <li>Ordered each memento by publication date</li>
            </ol>
            <li>It used <a href="https://github.com/oduwsdl/archiveit_utilities">Archive-It Utilities</a> to extract all metadata from the collection, such as who created the collection and the collection's name</li>
            <li>It analyzed all mementos to automatically discover the most frequent <a href="https://github.com/oduwsdl/sumgram">sumgrams</a> and named entities present in the overall story</li>
            <li>It analyzed all images in these mementos to automatically select the best image for the overall story</li>
            <li>It then formatted the data for the story based on all of this input</li>  
        </ol>
        <li><a href="https://oduwsdl.github.io/raintale/">Raintale</a> took the input from Hypercane and rendered the final product with information supplied by  <a href="https://mementoembed.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">MementoEmbed</a></li>
    </ol>
